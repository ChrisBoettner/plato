1. Find all stars in LOP field
2. Find thick disk/halo stars
3. Create model for planet detection efficiency based on number of cameras/planet radius/star magnitude
4. Estimate probability of detecting planets around those stars/what are the expected yields?

(Create field proper)
(Proper refined selection of thick disk/thin disk, only with limited sample of field, do it for real LOPS2 field and provional LOPN field)

KEEP PAPER BY ANDAMA 2024 in mind
also BITSCH 2020
CABRAL 2023
(remember Bertrands RED talk, also Alexandre)



Paper:

Motivation:
- (look at Bashi paper, differences in planet population bc of kinematics age etc)
- papers by Bertran Bitsch (from RED), C/O, alpha/Fe important for planet formation, and there is this devide in thick disk/thin disk stars ==> GREAT MOTIVATION
- also halo stars maybe ex-situ.. kinda cool to have planet formed in companion galaxy

1.Introduction

2. Stellar Sample and Classification
- classify into thin disk/thick disk/halo, and explain how (Akshara)
- subselect from asPIC (LOPS2 and maybe LOPN1, using platopoint)

- analyse sets a little: magnitudes (convert Gaia G to V from Montalto2021), metallicity (ask Akshara/Tom/Emma) about reliability

3. Detection probability
- noise model (Matuszewski)
- transit probability (do properly, with right masses and also with 'random' chance of first transit, but circular orbit)

4. Expected Planet Yields
- using NGPPS
- with and without netallicity - dependence
- but: minimum metallicity (ANDAMA2024)

$. Conclusions
